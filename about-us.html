                            CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was established following the educational vision of
                            St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, a pioneering educationist and social reformer in 19th-century
                            South India.
                            Since its inception as Christ College in 1969, the institution has grown in academic
                            excellence
                            and infrastructure. It was granted autonomy in 2004 and declared a deemed-to-be University
                            in 2008.
                        </p>

                            The Pune Lavasa Campus began as Christ Institute of Management in 2014 and achieved
                            Off-Campus status in 2018.
                            Today, it offers UG, PG, and PhD programmes across Commerce, Law, Data Science, Management,
                            and Humanities.
                            Nestled in the Sahyadri hills, the campus provides a serene and digitally advanced
                            environment for learning.
